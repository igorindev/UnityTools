# About

A Simple Embedded Script Editor inside Unity.

## Quick Start

Edit any .cs script inside Unity by right-clicking the script > Edit Script... The Simple Embedded Script Editor window will open inside Unity and show the script content.

## Options

You can type new text inside the Window to modify the code, and use Ctrl-Z and Ctrl-Y to Undo and Redo.
At the top of the Window there are two buttons. The left one will completely reset the code to the state it was in its last save. The right one will save the script and tell Unity to compile.

## Attention

This tool does not provide any kind of IntelliSense or helpers like IDE's, this is just a simple tool to allow quick and easy edits to pieces of the code without the need to open external programs.
